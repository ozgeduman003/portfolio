# Özge Duman, PhD  
**Data Scientist | Interpretable Machine Learning | Causal Reasoning**

I am a data scientist with a PhD background in modeling complex systems, specializing in interpretable machine learning, causal inference, and data-driven decision support.

My strength lies in translating complex, high-dimensional data into **reliable, explainable, and actionable insights**. I focus on going beyond correlation to understand **drivers, dependencies, and directionality** in real-world data — skills directly relevant to business, policy, and applied research settings.

## 🔹 What I Do

- Build end-to-end machine learning pipelines
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature assessment
- Compare, validate, and interpret predictive models
- Apply causal and directional reasoning to observational data
- Communicate analytical results clearly to non-technical stakeholders

## 🔹 Portfolio Projects

### 1️⃣ End-to-End Machine Learning Project

A complete supervised learning workflow using structured tabular data, covering data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model comparison, and evaluation.

This project reflects common industry problems such as churn prediction, risk scoring, and demand forecasting.

### 3️⃣ Interpretable Machine Learning

Applied analyses centered on understanding *why* models make predictions, not just how accurate they are.

Key themes:
- Feature importance and stability
- Model diagnostics
- Trade-offs between accuracy and explainability
- Trustworthy and transparent modeling

### 4️⃣ Causal Inference & Directionality  
**Case Study: Directional Coupling in Complex Systems (NATO Science for Peace Project)**

In addition to exploratory causal reasoning exercises, I have applied directional inference methods in a large-scale, externally validated research project conducted within a multi-year NATO Science for Peace and Security programme.

In this work, we analyzed complex interaction networks to infer **directional dependencies and long-range influence pathways** in ABC transporter systems. Rather than relying on correlation alone, we employed **direction-sensitive information flow measures** to identify which system components act as *drivers* versus *responders*.

Key aspects relevant to applied data science include:

- Inference of **directionality beyond correlation**
- Analysis of **high-dimensional interaction matrices**
- Identification of **key drivers and bottlenecks** in networked systems
- Validation of inferred relationships using **independent experimental evidence**
- Decision-oriented interpretation of complex dependency structures

The figure below illustrates directional coupling patterns across system components, highlighting asymmetric influence relationships that cannot be captured by standard correlation analysis.

This type of analysis directly parallels real-world business problems where:
- Interactions are complex and interdependent
- Controlled experiments are limited or impossible
- Understanding *drivers* of outcomes matters more than raw association
