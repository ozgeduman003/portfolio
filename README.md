# Ozge Duman – Data Scientist | Causal Inference | Experimentation | ML

Hi, I am Özge, a data scientist with a PhD in Engineering and a strong background in  
causal inference, experimentation, and large-scale scientific modeling.

I spent my PhD analyzing complex biological systems (GPCRs and allosteric networks) using  
machine learning, transfer entropy, and advanced statistical modeling. My work has led to  
peer-reviewed publications, a NATO-funded project on transfer entropy, and presentations at EMBO conferences.

I am now focusing on applying the same rigor and experimentation mindset to product and business problems:
A/B testing, causal impact, personalization, and data-driven decision making.

## 🧪 Highlighted Projects

### 1. Localization Causal Modeling & Experimentation
**Tech:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels, causal inference methods (ATE / CATE, uplift curves),  
A/B test evaluation, TE-inspired analysis

- Simulates a multilingual product environment with user engagement and retention as outcomes.
- Implements randomized experiments and observational causal inference to estimate the impact of different
  “localization strategies” on user behavior.
- Demonstrates how to:
  - Frame business questions as causal problems.
  - Design and evaluate experiments.
  - Build model-based estimators to guide product and content decisions.
- Includes clear documentation, visualizations, and interpretation of treatment effects and uncertainty.

> **Role:** End-to-end design (data generation, modeling, evaluation, interpretation).  
> **Focus:** Experimentation, causal inference, decision support.

### 2. Transfer Entropy Network Analysis in Protein Systems (NATO Project – Results Only)
**Tech:** Transfer Entropy, information theory, network analysis, Python (conceptually), scientific workflows

- Results-only reconstruction of my NATO-funded work applying **Transfer Entropy** to study directed
  information flow in protein systems.
- Contains:
  - Methodology summary (how TE is computed and interpreted).
  - Anonymized figures of information-flow networks.
  - Explanation of how source/target residues and “allosteric hotspots” are identified.
- Original code and raw data are not shared due to IP restrictions, but the repository documents
  the full analysis pipeline and the design of TE-based causal metrics.

> **Role:** Lead analyst and co-developer of TE workflow; first-author on peer-reviewed publication.  
> **Focus:** Causal information flow, robust methodology, communicating complex results to scientific stakeholders.

### 3. GPCR Dynamic Modeling & Ensemble Analysis (PhD Research – Synthetic/Public Data)
**Tech:** Python/Matlab, PCA, clustering, network analysis, MD/ENM-style features, scientific plotting

- Showcases the data and modeling concepts used in my PhD on **GPCR activation and allosteric signaling**,
  reconstructed on synthetic or public structural data.
- Includes:
  - Example of feature engineering from 3D structures and trajectories.
  - Normal mode / correlation-like analysis.
  - Clustering of conformational states and visualization of transition pathways.
- Demonstrates how to handle high-dimensional, noisy scientific data and extract interpretable signals
  that guide hypotheses and decisions.

> **Role:** Full pipeline design and implementation; presented results at EMBO conferences. The project was funded by the Turkish Health Institutes (TUSEB) and the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Türkiye (TÜBİTAK).
> **Focus:** Complex modeling, experimental design, comprehensive analysis of high-dimensional data.

### 4. Recommender Systems & Personalization (Rebuild of Course Project)
**Tech:** Python, R,  pandas, NumPy, LightFM / Surprise / scikit-learn, ranking metrics (Precision@K, Recall@K, NDCG)

- Modern, clean re-implementation of my earlier recommender system project.
- Builds multiple recommendation strategies:
  - Baseline popularity and similarity models.
  - Matrix factorization–based recommender.
  - Hybrid strategy with user and item features.
- Provides robust evaluation with ranking metrics and clear discussion of trade-offs between models
  (accuracy vs. coverage, cold start, etc.).

> **Role:** End-to-end design and implementation.  
> **Focus:** Personalization, ranking, offline evaluation, practical model comparison.
