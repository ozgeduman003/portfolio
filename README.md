# Özge Duman, PhD  
**Data Scientist | Interpretable Machine Learning | Causal Reasoning**

I am a data scientist with a PhD background in modeling complex systems, specializing in interpretable machine learning, causal inference, and data-driven decision support.

My strength lies in translating complex, high-dimensional data into **reliable, explainable, and actionable insights**. I focus on going beyond correlation to understand **drivers, dependencies, and directionality** in real-world data — skills directly relevant to business, policy, and applied research settings.

## 🔹 What I Do

- Build end-to-end machine learning pipelines
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature assessment
- Compare, validate, and interpret predictive models
- Apply causal and directional reasoning to observational data
- Communicate analytical results clearly to non-technical stakeholders

## 🔹 Portfolio Projects

### 1️⃣ End-to-End Machine Learning Project

A complete supervised learning workflow using structured tabular data, covering data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model comparison, and evaluation.

This project reflects common industry problems such as churn prediction, risk scoring, and demand forecasting.

### 3️⃣ Interpretable Machine Learning

Applied analyses centered on understanding *why* models make predictions, not just how accurate they are.

Key themes:
- Feature importance and stability
- Model diagnostics
- Trade-offs between accuracy and explainability
- Trustworthy and transparent modeling

---

### 4️⃣ Causal Inference & Directionality

Exploratory work on causal reasoning in data science, inspired by my research background in directional information flow in complex systems.

Topics include:
- Correlation vs causation
- Confounder bias
- Directionality in observational data
- Time-lagged effects

These concepts are critical for decision-making when randomized experiments are not feasible.

## 🔹 Background

I hold a PhD in Chemical Engineering with extensive experience in statistical modeling, machine learning, and large-scale data analysis. My academic research involved working with noisy, high-dimensional datasets and developing interpretable inference methods — challenges that closely mirror real-world business data problems.

I have worked in interdisciplinary and international teams and enjoy translating complex analytical methods into practical insights.
